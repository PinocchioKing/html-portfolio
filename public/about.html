<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Adrian and I am from Malaysia. I am 27 years
  this year (2023). I am currently working as an electrical
  engineer is a consulting firm for constructions. 
</p>

<p>
  During my free time I play some basketball and go to
  the gym whenever I can. Due to a sport injury, I am
  currently MIA from all physical activities at the moment.
</p>

<p>
  Since I am unable to do any sports, exercise or weights
  for now. I have currently picked up coding to replace
  those physical activities. I have previously did some
  coding through verilog and some C but have forgotten 
  the language. I am starting over using HTML, Python and
  and JavaScript. 
</p>

<p>
  Since I am learning these languages, I hope I am able
  to start woking on cool and fun projects in the future,
  be it for fun or for side hustle. As many have pointed
  out that coding is a language that everyone needs to 
  know at least the basic and I agree.
